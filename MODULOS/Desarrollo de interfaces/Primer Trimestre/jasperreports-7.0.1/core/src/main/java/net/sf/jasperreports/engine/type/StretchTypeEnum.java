/**
 * There are two main reasons for an element to stretch.
 * <p>
 * First, there is the natural stretch of the element, which is caused by the element growing naturally in order to display its entire content.
 * This is the case with text fields that have isStretchWithOverflow set to true and thus growing in height in order to display all the rows of text 
 * that the value of their text field expression provides at runtime.
 * <p>
 * Secondly, there is the forced stretch of an element, which in addition to its natural growth required by its own content, needs to further grow
 * to match the growing height of some other element that it is put in relation with at report design time.
 * <p>
 * A forced stretch can be imposed to elements that are part of element groups (JRElementGroup) or element containers (bands, frames, table cells, list cells, etc.).
 * The forced stretch also comes in two flavors.
 * <br>
 * There is element group stretch and container stretch.
 * <br>
 * Element group stretch is forced upon an element by the natural growth of the other elements in the same group.
 * <br>
 * The container stretch is forced upon an element by all types of growth that the container itself suffers, 
 * including forced container stretch imposed onto the container by its own parent container.
